# Interference and Noise Robust Image Reconstruction

## Abstract 

Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a recently introduced medical imaging modality using the nonlinear magnetization response of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Partial field-of-view Center Imaging (PCI) is a novel robust x-space image 
reconstruction for MPI developed with the motivation of eliminating non-ideal effects on the signal. PCI and Lumped-PCI methods offer a trade-off between interference and noise robustness. PCI offers robustness against harmonic interferences, whereas Lumped PCI offers  robustness against noise. This project aims to develop an image reconstruction technique for 
MPI that simultaneously improves interference and noise robustness, effectively combining PCI and Lumped-PCI in an optimized fashion.
